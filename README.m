SalesFlow Analytics Engine
Project Overview
A comprehensive containerized end-to-end sales data analytics platform that transforms raw CSV data into actionable business insights using Docker, Python, PostgreSQL, and advanced SQL analytics. This project demonstrates full-stack data pipeline development with enterprise-grade containerization from data ingestion to complex business intelligence queries.

üê≥ Docker-Powered Architecture
Containerization Benefits
Environment Consistency: Docker ensures identical development, testing, and production environments
Scalable Deployment: Easy horizontal scaling across multiple containers
Isolation & Security: Database and application layers run in isolated containers
Zero-Dependency Setup: One-command deployment regardless of host system
Production-Ready: Container orchestration ready for cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP)
Container Infrastructure
PostgreSQL Container: Dedicated database container with persistent volume mounting
Python Analytics Container: Isolated Jupyter environment for data processing
Network Isolation: Secure container-to-container communication
Volume Management: Persistent data storage across container restarts
